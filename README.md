BECCA is a general learning program for use in any robot or embodied system. It consists of an automatic feature creator and a model-based reinforcement learner. When using BECCA, a robot learns to do whatever it is rewarded to do, and continues learning throughout its lifetime.

To see a demo, just run benchmark.py. The users guide in the repo has detailed documentation on how to use BECCA in your application. The Google group BECCA_users provides a forum for users to share questions, solutions, and experiences. Additional forums, tools, and documentation are available at openbecca.org, the homepage for the open source BECCA project.
