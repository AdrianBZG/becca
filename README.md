BECCA is a general learning program for use in any robot or embodied system. It consists of a hierarchical feature learner and an incremental reinforcement learner. When using BECCA, a robot learns to do whatever it is rewarded to do, and continues learning throughout its lifetime.

To see a demo, just run benchmark.py. The repository [wiki](https://github.com/brohrer/becca/wiki) has detailed documentation on how to use BECCA in your application and on [how it works](https://github.com/brohrer/becca/blob/master/doc/how_it_works.pdf?raw=true). A series of [videos](http://youtu.be/4kPoU8eZvio?list=PLF861CC4C40439EEB) on YouTube demonstrate BECCA's performance in a few different contexts. The Google group [BECCA_users](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/becca_users) provides a forum for users to share questions, solutions, and experiences. A few [publications](https://github.com/brohrer/publications) describe earlier versions and applications of BECCA. Additional forums, tools, and documentation are available at [openbecca.org](http://openbecca.org/), the homepage for the open source BECCA project.
