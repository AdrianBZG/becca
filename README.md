\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 BECCA is a general learning program for use in any robot or embodied system. When using BECCA, a robot learns to do whatever it is rewarded to do, and continues learning throughout its lifetime.\

To see a demo, just run benchmark.py. The [wiki](https://github.com/brohrer/becca/wiki) has tutorials on how to use BECCA in your application and on [how it works](https://github.com/brohrer/becca/blob/master/doc/how_it_works.pdf?raw=true). A series of [videos](http://youtu.be/4kPoU8eZvio?list=PLF861CC4C40439EEB) demonstrate BECCA's performance in a few different contexts. The [BECCA_users group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/becca_users) provides a forum for users to share questions, solutions, and experiences. A few [publications](https://github.com/brohrer/publications) describe earlier versions and applications of BECCA. \
